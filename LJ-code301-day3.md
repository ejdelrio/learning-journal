<h1> Learning Journal Code 301 - Day 3</h1>

Dear dairy,

Today we used Jquery for some heavy DOM manipulation The whole process went smooth, for the most part. The last one was a bit of a Pain in the but.
Bt other than that, everything is going peachy. I feel like I'v lost ome steam over the week long break. :(
