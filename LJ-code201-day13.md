<h1>Learning Journal Day 13</h1>

Dear Diary,

Today we learned how to do persistent storage. Overall it was just dandy. I really realized the value and importance of modularity.
Spending a little bit of extra time to segment my code early on made it much easier to modify later, saving me tons of time over all.
All that extra time allows me to help my peers and develop my ability to review code :D.
