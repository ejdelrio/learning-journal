Today I learned more detailed methods of using git. These methods included creating additional branches and repos locally,
changing the current repo, as well as establishing a connection between remote and local repos. I also learned how two developers can be workig on the same project at the same time and still prevent contaminating eachothers work by using seperate branches. 

Additionally, we covered for, while and do while loops. But these are remedial.
