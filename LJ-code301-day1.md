<h1>Learning Journal Code 301 Day #1 </h1>

Dear Diary, 

Today we started learning about dynamic web displays. I found it hard to pay attention. I was "Hella" sleepy and the class was 
Just plain hard to follow. But I feel Like I can get ahead if I just go hard on the paint and cram with CSS :D

P.S. I hate CSS.

With Love,

Eddie
