<h1>Learning Journal Day 11</h1>

<p>Dear Diary, 
Today I learned how to embed videos into projects. 
Additionally, I learned how to create eventListeners that link button elements to video elements.
Most of it seems pretty easy to grasp at this point. It's minimally challenging.
Right now I'm more focused on planning for the coming final project.
