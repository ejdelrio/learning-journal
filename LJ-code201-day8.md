Dear diary,

	Today I learned how to use various inputs along with more table manipulation. That being said, I can firmly say 
that I do no like working with tables. The project by itself was simple but can easily become more difficult if
 another dimension is thrown in there. The prototype methods made the whole process a million times easier :D
