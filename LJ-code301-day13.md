<h1>Learning Journal Day 13-Code 301</h1>

Dear Diary...

Today we learned how to deploy our sites on Heroku. I'm so excited and I just can't hide it. It is a bit on the slow side but oh well. It's free so I can't really complain.
Also, I learned how to construct a BST and do some crazy stuff with for loops. I'm talking off the hook level stuff. Game changers. Show stoppers...
