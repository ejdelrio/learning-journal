<h1>Learning Journal Day 15-Code 301</h1>

Dear Diary,

Today we learned a little bit about SCSS and reviewed Code 301. It was "hella" relaxed. I started working on the final project and realized we actually jammed a crap ton of stuff into this course without even realizing it. It's gonna take a moment to review all of this. :D
With Love,

Eddie
